#### Motivation

The ECP communinity and the larger HPC community is increasingly using Python for scientific software. The idea of these materials is to extract the essential steps to creating a professional package from the large and varied pool of on-line resources.


#### Possible capture of User Story

As a Software Developer on a small Python project, I want to better understand the tools and processes available to support packaging, testing, documentation and deployment so that I can create a robust and well maintained package.
