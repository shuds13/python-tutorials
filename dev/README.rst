----------------------------------------------

This is a space for generating Python materials 

For possible inclusion in Better Scientifc Software (BSSw) webpage.

Outline - this is completely speculative and is based on experiences.

Overview of possible Python content:
 - Motivation: Python in HPC ? / Key Concepts
 - Creating a PYPI package -> see python.pypi-packaging.md
 - Conda: Pros/issues (e.g. MPI)/use for on-line CI...
 - Testing - eg. pytest/coverage (inc. Combining unit and regression tests). Online CI/coverage tools.
 - Documentation - Sphinx/autodoc/breathe(linking with doxygen content)/readthedocs
